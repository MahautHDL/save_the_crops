# Save the Crops

This is the final project we did while following our bootcamp "Data Science & AI" at Le Wagon. We created an app to predict diseases of the following crops: cashew, cassava, maize and tomato.
This app also has a frontend, of which the code can be found here: https://github.com/MahautHDL/save_the_crops_front. The frontend itself is not up-and-running anymore.

### Dataset
We used the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nirmalsankalana/crop-pest-and-disease-detection
The dataset has over 25.000 pictures of 4 crops. Each crop was divided in classes: 1 healty and 4-6 of the most common diseases per crop.

### What we did
* Data Analysis
* Clean the data
* Data Preprocessing
* Create a model
* Save the model in Tensorboard
* Visualise the results of the model
* Evaluate the model
* Predict with the model
* Put the model online and connect it to the frontend
* Create a frontend (https://github.com/MahautHDL/save_the_crops_front)
